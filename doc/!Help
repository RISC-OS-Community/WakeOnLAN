Help for !WakeOnLAN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

!WakeOnLAN (WOL) is a simple utility that can be used both on the RISC OS Desktop or in the CLI to wake up devices on the local network that supports WOL protocol.

Given that !WakeOnLAN is usable via both the WIMP and the CLI it's a very usefu utility, because you could, for example, use it in some automation to ensure your NAS is awake before you start a backup. Or run it at a given time (or date) using !Alarm and so on and so forth. Of course you can use it manually via the WIMP or in a taskWindow as well.

- Using !WakeOnLAN via CLI -
When your RISC OS Filer has seen the !WakeOnLAN app it will create an alias that allow you to call !WakeOnLAN simply using:

*wakeonlan

If you do that !WakeOnLAN will display an help message with its syntax, like this one:

Syntax: *wakeonlan -m <mac address> [ -b <broadcast address> ] [-v]
        Where <mac address> has to be the MAC of the device you want to wake up. (MAC syntax: 01:02:03:04:05:06)
        And   <broadcast address> is a valid broadcast address for you LAN. (broadcast syntax: xxx.yyy.hhh.zzz
        -v specify you want verbose output

While if you double click on the !WakeOnLAN icon it will load on the desktop and you can use it via WIMP.

Hope this utility will be useful to you, enjoy!
All the best,
